STARTUP SIMULATOR
----------

Startup Simulator was a late HackRPI project by Theo Browne and Courtney Tambling. The
goal is to create a tycoon-style web game with a sarcastic take on the Silicon Valley startup
scene.

Although we failed to complete this project at HackRPI (both contributers were working on
separate web dev projects at first), we did complete a representative back-end state in Python
and start a functional front-end. Both developers intend to continue working on this project,
and will be pushing some fun things soon.

VERSION
----------
v0.0.1
